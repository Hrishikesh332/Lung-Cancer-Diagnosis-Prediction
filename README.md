The Project "Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction of Lung Cancer" is aim towards: finding the insights from the dataset, so that we can create a concrete conclusion out of it and to perform exploratory data analysis. Also we are going to apply machine learning model to predict the lung cancer diagnosis.
